#### Adding New Coin Desklet

**To add new crypto-coin as a Desklet, please follow the steps below:**

1. Open the Rainmeter skins directory, usually **`C:\Users\#YourName#\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\ilius\CryptoCoins`**
2. Copy the **`Bitcoin`** folder and name it the as crypto-coin you want to add e.g. **`Dash`**
3. Go into the folder and rename the **`Bitcoin.ini`** file to **`Dash.ini`**, now you should have **`C:\Users\#YourName#\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\ilius\CryptoCoins\Dash\Dash.ini`**
4. Open the file with any editor and change:
	- Change the **`ApiKey`** to the API key you got from your CoinMarketCap account
    - Change the **`CoinSymbol`** to the **Symbol** of the crypto-coin you want to add e.g. **`CoinSymbol=DASH`** (make sure it is in upper case)
		- In some rare cases where some currencies have the same symbol e.g. BTCV you can also use **`CoinID=5175`** to specify exactly which currency to show. 
		- You can find the **`CoinID`** by going on the tools section for your coin e.g. `https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin-vault/tools/` and in the Website Widget section find the following field **`data-currencyid`** in this case **`data-currencyid="5175"`** 
    - Change the **`Currency`** to the desired **Currency** you want to see the price as e.g. **`Currency=USD`** (make sure it is in upper case). You can find all supported currencies on this page: https://coinmarketcap.com/api/documentation/v1/#section/Standards-and-Conventions
5. Save the changes, now you can add your coin desklet from the `Manage` window, check the Usage section for more details

*NOTE: This Dekslet comes with more than 420+ crypto-coins icons out of the box but in the case when the coin icon is not displayed for your coin that means you need to add the icon:*

- Download an icon for you crypto-coin and move it to **`C:\Users\#YourName#\Documents\Rainmeter\Skins\ilius\@Resources\icons\`**
- Make sure the icon is named the same as the **`CoinSymbol`** e.g. **`dash.png`**
